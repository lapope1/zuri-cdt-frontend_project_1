# Website Recreation Project: Check My Student ID

## Description

This project which is a **Zuri continous development training** **frontend track project,** involves recreating the main page of the website [Check My Postcode](https://checkmypostcode.uk/), while making specific modifications as outlined below. The focus will be on using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to replicate the structure and design of the original page.

## Instructions

1. **Recreate the Main Page:** The goal is to recreate the main page of the [Check My Postcode](https://checkmypostcode.uk/) website. The project will only consist of the main page and will not include any internal links or additional pages.

2. **Change Main Title:** Modify the main title of the page from "Check My Postcode" to "Check My Student ID." This title change will reflect prominently on the recreated page.

3. **Replace Mentions of "Postcode":** Throughout the recreated page, every instance of the word "Postcode" or "postcode" will be replaced with "Student ID." This change will be applied consistently to maintain coherence with the modified title.

4. **Form Implementation:** A form similar to the original page's form will be included, allowing users to enter their "Student ID." The form may not necessarily submit; this is a frontend task only. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the form's structure and styling is the goal.

5. **Styling and Layout:** Pay attention to the styling and layout of the page. Intense effort will be make to match the design of the styling and layout of the page as closely as possible while accommodating the changes mentioned above.
